# Git Worktree

I made this extension because I started using git worktrees and I wanted to
make it easier to manage and setup.

There are some sensible defaults but everything is customizable ðŸ¥³

Hopefully it helps and enjoy ðŸ‘‹

## Features

These are a list of features that I have currently implemented

#### Clone Command

By default if you use the clone command it create a directory structure like
this:

```bash
â”œâ”€â”€ .bare
â”œâ”€â”€ .git
â”œâ”€â”€ worktree-1 <--
```

Then when adding worktrees, they will live along side. This in my opinion is
much cleaner and cleaner to manage
